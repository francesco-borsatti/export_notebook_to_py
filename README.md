# Export ipython Notebook to python script file

In a jupyter notebook, if you want to export just some cells, put in their first line `#_CELL_TO_EXPORT_#`.

You can add the function `export_notebook()` to your notebook and just run the cell when you want to export just the code blocks you selected to a python file.
